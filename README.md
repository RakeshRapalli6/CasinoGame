This project is about one of the games of casino among many played over there,
the game i am developing is it has an button called "spin" and a player hits that button
it starts spinning the whole grid of 5 * 3 consists of random alphabets, numbers as credits and when this credits reaches a certain point you get an oppertunity to spin the grid again where the only difference this time is you get credits that fills up the grid, based on the num of credits you got, it will be translated to actual money(1.00$ == 100 credits) and if the whole grid is filled with credits then you recieve a grand(total amount of people played went into the machine which will be 1,00,000 as of now), you can also get mini(1000c) and minor(2000c) and major(500000)
